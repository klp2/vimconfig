"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
" This file implements a file explorer.
"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
" Normally, this file will reside in the plugins directory and be
" automatically sourced.  If not, you must manually source this file
" using :source explorer.vim
"
" To use it, just edit a directory (vi dirname) or type :Explore to
" launch the file explorer in the current window, or :Sexplore to split
" the current window and launch explorer there.
"
" If the current buffer is modified, the window is always split.
"
" It is also possible to delete files and rename files within explorer.
" See :help file-explorer for more details

" Update history removed, it's not very interesting.
